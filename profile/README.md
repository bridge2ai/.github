The NIH Common Fund’s Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) program will propel biomedical research forward by setting the stage for widespread adoption
of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches for tackling complex biomedical challenges. 
A key step in this process is generating new “flagship” data sets and best practices for ML analysis. 
For more information, please visit [our website](https://bridge2ai.org/).

## Overview of some of the key public repositories in this organization:
- [b2ai-standards-registry](https://github.com/bridge2ai/b2ai-standards-registry) - Standards Registry and Use Case Catalog, including data models, API specification, and other documentation.
Intended to support generation of standardized, interoperable, and machine-readable data from biomedical research.
- [standards-schema](https://github.com/bridge2ai/standards-schemas) - Data schema for Bridge2AI Standards Schemas (built using [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml)).
